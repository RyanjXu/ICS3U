Provided 2 approaches to this assignment,
one utilizes array extension and the other one 
exploits the restrictions on possible employee IDs.
One of the boolean array methods automatically sorts the IDs in ascending order while the other maintains the original order as read.
The HashMap array represents a far more efficient solution that is out of the scope of this assignment.
